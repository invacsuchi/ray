## Rockstar: A Film That Divided Critics and Audiences
 
Rockstar is a film that received mixed reviews from critics and audiences alike. Some praised the film for its unconventional storytelling, realistic portrayal of a musician's life, and Ranbir Kapoor's outstanding performance. Others criticized the film for its confusing narrative, weak female character, and lack of emotional impact. The film has a rating of 7.7/10 on IMDb based on 206 user reviews[^1^], and a rating of 83% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 6 critic reviews.
 
One of the positive reviews came from Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN, who gave the film 4 out of 5 stars and wrote: \"Just to see him work his magic on screen, Rockstar is worth a watch. But while good acting is always an incentive, it's a director's vision that makes a film truly watchable, and Imtiaz makes Rockstar stand out from what the mainstream churns out every week. And brings back the one aspect sorely missing from Hindi films lately -- music.\"[^1^]
 
Another positive review came from Anupama Chopra of NDTV, who gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote: \"Rockstar is a rousing rebellion anthem that will strike a chord with anyone who has ever dreamed big. It's also an uneven film that doesn't fully tap into its own potential. But I recommend that you see it for Ranbir Kapoor's heartfelt performance and for AR Rahman's brilliant music.\"[^1^]
 
One of the negative reviews came from Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express, who gave the film 2 out of 5 stars and wrote: \"Rockstar is a long, loopy ride which leaves you both exhausted and exhilarated. It could have been a great film but it is not. It has too much fuzz going around it to be coherent. But it also has moments which show us what it could have been.\"[^1^]
 
Another negative review came from Mayank Shekhar of Hindustan Times, who gave the film 2 out of 5 stars and wrote: \"The movie is a journey of a young ambitious boy from his being Janarthan to Jordan and in a symbolic manner raises several questions about independence and democracy. Imtiaz Ali is a fabulous story teller and his previous work reflects those but with Rockstar he goes a level higher.\"[^1^]
