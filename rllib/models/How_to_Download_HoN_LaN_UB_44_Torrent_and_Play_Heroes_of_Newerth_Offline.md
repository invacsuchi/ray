## What is a Torrent File?
 
A torrent file is a small file that contains information about a larger file that you want to download. It tells your torrent client (a software that downloads torrents) where to find the file and how to download it from other users who have it.
 
To download a torrent file, you need two things: a torrent client and a torrent tracker. A torrent client is a software that downloads torrents, such as uTorrent, BitTorrent, or qBittorrent. A torrent tracker is a website that hosts torrent files and helps users find each other, such as The Pirate Bay, Kickass Torrents, or RARBG.
